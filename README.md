# Exploratory_Data_Analysis_with_R


## Overview
This project showcases an exploratory data analysis (EDA) using R programming language. The goal is to demonstrate diverse characteristics of a dataset through multiple types of graphs. In this example, we utilize the famous "iris" dataset, which is readily available in R.

## Requirements
Before running the code, ensure that you have the following R packages installed:
- ggplot2
- dplyr
- tidyr
- ggpubr
- corrplot

You can install these packages using the `install.packages()` function.

## Code Structure
- `eda_r_analysis.R`: Main R script containing the code for data loading, summary statistics, and various graphical representations.
  
## Running the Code
1. Open the R script `eda_r_analysis.R`.
2. Run the script in your R environment.

## Graphical Representations
1. **Pairwise Scatterplots:** Visualizing relationships between continuous variables.
2. **Boxplots:** Displaying the distribution of each variable by species.
3. **Density Plots:** Illustrating the density distribution of variables by species.
4. **Correlation Matrix Plot:** Visualizing the correlation matrix.
5. **Bar Plot:** Showing the distribution of a categorical variable (Species).
6. **Violin Plot:** Representing the distribution of a continuous variable by species.

Feel free to adapt the code for your specific dataset and analysis requirements.
